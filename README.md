# React Native Chat Assistant for Android/ IOS
# React Native App v1 

This project is a **Hello World Chat Assistant** built using **React Native** and **Expo**, designed for seamless functionality across **Android**, **iOS**, and **desktop devices**. The app provides a clean, user-friendly interface to interact with a basic chat assistant, leveraging cutting-edge backend technologies for dynamic responses.  

## Features  

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:  
  Developed with React Native and Expo, the app runs smoothly on Android, iOS, and desktop platforms, ensuring broad accessibility and simplified development.  

- **Backend Integration**:  
  Harnesses **AWS API Gateway**, **AWS Lambda**, and **Bedrock** to deliver robust and scalable backend services.  

- **AI-Powered Chat Assistant**:  
  The assistant leverages **Claude Sonnet**, providing intelligent conversational capabilities for users.  

- **Responsive Frontend**:  
  A React Native-powered UI with Expo enhancements for fast and intuitive user interaction.  

## How It Works  

1. **Frontend**:  
   The React Native app, powered by Expo, serves as the user interface, allowing users to send messages and receive intelligent responses in real time.  

2. **Backend**:  
   - **AWS API Gateway**: Handles requests between the app and backend.  
   - **AWS Lambda**: Executes serverless functions for processing requests.  
   - **Bedrock**: Powers advanced AI capabilities with **Claude Sonnet** for natural language processing.  

3. **Deployment**:  
   Deploy once and use across multiple platforms with a consistent experience on mobile and desktop devices.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- Node.js and npm/yarn installed  
- **Expo CLI** installed globally:  
   ```bash  
   npm install -g expo-cli  
   ```  
- AWS account for backend integration  

### Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
